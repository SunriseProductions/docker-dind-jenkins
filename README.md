###Docker Jenkins with Docker in Docker

A docker container based on the docker-plugin Jenkins SSH slave (https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/evarga/jenkins-slave/) and 
the docker-in-docker container (https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind). This allows cloud based Jenkins using docker with docker support
in the slaves.
